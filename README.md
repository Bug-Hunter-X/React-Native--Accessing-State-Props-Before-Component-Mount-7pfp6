This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access component state or props before the component has fully mounted.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, resulting in `undefined` errors.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) shows how to correctly access props and state after the component is mounted using `componentDidMount`.  This example highlights the importance of understanding React's lifecycle methods.
